# Battleships Game Engine
This is my implementation of [florinpop17's app idea](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/3-Advanced/Battleship-Game-Engine.md).
It's still in development and contains basic features. It doesn't contain any interactive layer yet and probably will
never be added to this project. The reason behind that is that I want to keep it an engine, a core on which you could
build such interactive applications. Therefore, if I were to make one, it would be published in a different repo.

## Features
- Creating new game
- Using custom board width and height (at least 4x4)
- 3 types of ships
- Putting ships on the board manually
- Putting ships on the board automatically (random spot, with an iterative algorithm)
- Shooting ships on board
- Tracking ships' HP
- Unicode printing current game board as well as hit-miss board
